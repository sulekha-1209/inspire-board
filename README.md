# Inspire Board

## About

I love the idea of setting a single-minded goal and looking at it regularly to remind yourself to keep working towards it. I use a Chrome extension for that but I wanted better background images and I don't want the goal on my board to disappear until I have marked it as finished and not just have it refreshed daily. 
So I created this simple responsive application to help me focus better.
